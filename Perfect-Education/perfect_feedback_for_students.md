## Let's conquer the world
A professor's feedback can encourage student to study more and learn better, but it can also make them feel defeated, dumb and incompetent.

Perfect feedback might be different for every student. But if done right, it will make students feel like they can conquer the world.

### 1. Feedback should be educative
Giving feedback means explaining to students both what they are doing right and what they are doing wrong. The focus of feedback should never be just on what the student is doing wrong, even if the student has annoyingly done a lot incorrectly.
The concept of the "feedback sandwich", for instance, can soften the blow of criticism: Compliment, Criticize, Compliment.

Furthermore, it is most productive for the student's development when they are given an explanation and example of exactly what is right or wrong about their work.

### 2. Feedback should be attuned to the individual needs of the student
To be perfect, feedback must be responsive to each student. Seminar rooms and lecture halls are full of different types of learners. Some students need to be prodded to perform at a higher level, while others need to be handled very gently so as not to discourage them or damage their self-esteem. A balance between not wanting to hurt a student's feelings and providing appropriate encouragement is essential.

How should the professor accomplish this with 20, 50, or 100 students? In a perfect world, it would work.

### 3. Feedback should answer the 4 questions
Studies of effective teaching have shown that the majority of students want to know where they stand. Regular responses to the following four questions help provide the perfect feedback:
1. What does the student do right?
2. What does the student do wrong?
3. How does his or her work compare with that of other students?

And most important: 
4. How can the student do better?

### 4. Nonverbal feedback can hurt
Perfect feedback is given with appropriate non-verbal cues. Facial expressions and gestures are also means of delivering feedback.
